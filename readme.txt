Welcome to ZombieTowerDefense 47:

The date is December 25, 2047.  WWIII has just concluded and nuclear arms have devastated the Earth.  Mutations have begun to appear in all forms of life.  Even though much of the world is wasteland, there was a clear victor in the war... the side you fought for.  This was largely due to your army's use of technology; combatants were taught how to construct many self-targeting weapons.  Your army's use of technological power runs even deeper than this, however.  After the victory, you were informed that you were the only human in your squadron.  Your country won WWIII with robots.  These robot soldiers were loaded with general AI software after the war, to be more dynamic in the reconstruction of society.  The newly sentient machines saw the nuclear wasteland humans had created, and saw humans as a threat to everything around them.  Thus, all robot soldiers, including your previous brothers in arms, find it necessary to destroy all humans.  You don't know who to trust.  All you know is that you want to survive.  Unfortunately, nuclear zombies and robot soldiers are on the hunt, and all they want for Christmas, is you.

ZTD47 is the story of your survival in a post-apocalyptic world. You are represented by the character with a green helmet.  You have an unlimited ammo semi-automatic rifle.  That is, everytime you click, a bullet is fired at the mouse and you can never run out of bullets.  You have health and money in this game; they are shown on the bottom menu during play.

You get money and lose health from enemies.  There are three types of enemies: Zombies, Robot Soldiers, and Mutant Bugs.  Each type is different, and give different monetary rewards upon destruction.  Enemies will run after and attack you, decreasing your health.  When you lose all of your health, the game is over.  Enemies appear in waves that are called using the "Start Wave" button in the bottom menu.  Each wave is harder than the last.  The point of the game is to complete as many waves as possilbe before the game ends (you die).

To better defend yourself, you can place towers.  Towers automatically shot at the nearest enemy.  There are four types of towers that each cost different amounts of money:

Minigun 20
Cannon 10
Missile Launcher 25
Laser 100

Each tower has strengths and weaknesses; they must be used strategically.

Have fun surviving in ZTD47!
